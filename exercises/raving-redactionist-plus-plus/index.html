      <h2>SCP-096</h2>

      <p>
        SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height.
        Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild malnutrition.
        Arms are grossly out of proportion with the rest of the subject's body, with an approximate length of 1.5 meters each.
        Skin is mostly <span class="secret redacted">devoid of pigmentation</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        SCP-096's jaw can open to four (4) times the norm of an average human.
        Other facial features remain similar to an average human, with the exception of the <span class="secret redacted">eyes</span>, which are also devoid of pigmentation.
        It is not yet known whether SCP-096 is blind or not. It shows no signs of any higher brain functions, and is not considered to be sapient.
      </p>

      <p>
        SCP-096 is normally extremely docile, with pressure sensors inside its cell indicating it spends most of the day pacing by the eastern wall.
        However, when someone views SCP-096's face, whether it be directly, via video recording, or even a photograph, it will enter a stage of <span class="secret redacted">considerable emotional distress</span>.
        SCP-096 will cover its face with its hands and begin <span class="secret redacted">screaming, crying, and babbling</span> incoherently.
        Approximately one (1) to two (2) minutes after the first viewing, SCP-096 will begin running to the person who viewed its face (who will from this point on be referred to as SCP-096-1).
      </p>

      <p>
        Documented speeds have varied from thirty-five (35) km/h to <span class="secret redacted">126 km/h</span>, and seems to depend on distance from SCP-096-1. At this point, no known material or method can impede SCP-096's progress.
        The actual position of SCP-096-1 does not seem to affect SCP-096's response; it seems to have an innate sense of <span class="secret redacted">SCP-096-1's location</span>.
        Note: This reaction does not occur when viewing artistic depictions (see Document <span class="secret redacted">096-1</span>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon arriving at SCP-096-1's location, SCP-096 will proceed to <span class="secret redacted">kill and [DATA EXPUNGED]</span> SCP-096-1. <span class="secret redacted">100</span>% of cases have left no traces of SCP-096-1.
        SCP-096 will then sit down for several minutes before regaining its composure and becoming docile once again. It will then attempt to make its way back to its natural habitat.
