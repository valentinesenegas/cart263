# Selection Test for the Mars Exploration Program
## By Valentine Sénégas

The *Selection Test for the Mars Exploration Program* is a recruitment tool to select the most brilliant Earthlings to represent us on the Red Planet!
Seriously, this test consists of several mini-games which will test different skills, such as short-term memory, mathematical abilities, and focus. The goal is simple: entertain players in innovative ways using machine learning and voice recognition. For instance, one of the games combines hand gestures with mental calculation. These new ways of interacting make the game more difficult, but also funnier!

The Mars Exploration Program is a hot topic, and as always, I love to use themes related to current events ([throwback to my previous game about a *unique* president](https://valentinesenegas.github.io/cart253/projects/project2/final/)).

This game was inspired by Brain Age, a game on Nintendo DS that I loved to play in my childhood. I took inspiration from some of the exercises and expanded them to use new technologies.

This game uses [ml5.js Handpose](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/handpose), [annyang](https://www.talater.com/annyang/) and illustrations from Freepik.
