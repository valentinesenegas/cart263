This is a game inspired by the movie The Platform directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia.
The story takes place in a tall prison with many floors. Inmates are in groups of two, and each group lives on a floor. Every day, a platform with lots of food comes down, the ones on the higher levels have plenty of food, and the ones at the bottom eat what is left, but most of the time, no food reaches the bottom.
This game is a metaphor about privilege that can be interpreted in multiple ways.
Humans are greedy, they want to keep everything for themselves without thinking about the consequences of their actions. People are not born with the same chances. But there is enough resources for everybody if we consume reasonably.
The movie is not only a critique about our economic system and class inequalities, but it also questions our relation to the environment. What kind of planet are we going to give to our children? Will future generations be endangered by our current behavior?
The interpretation that we decide to make is our own, but it is definitely worth thinking about.
With this game, I hope to encourage players to think about how individual actions can affect others, and how a system that seems impossible to change could be overturned by individuals who are not afraid to contest the status quo.
